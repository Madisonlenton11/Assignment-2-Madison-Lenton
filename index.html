            <h1>2023 Horror Movie Wrap-Up</h1>
            <h2>With the year coming to a close, itâ€™s important to reflect on what transpired through it all. 2023 was
                an interesting year in the case of horror movies, filled with some of its highest highs in a long while,
                as well as some lows. This year has been one of the most divisive for horror fans when reflecting back
                on everything which has been released. In a genre which many disregard as only being made up of cheap
                jumpscares, a fantasization of gore and the same cookie cutter structure, this year showcases quite the
                opposite; packed with experimental films and new sub-genres brought to the big screen potentially
                forever changing the genre of horror for times to come. </h2>
